# 🖋️ Handwritten Alphabet Classification 🖋️  

This project tackles the classification of A-Z handwritten alphabets using the [Handwritten Alphabets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format). The dataset consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to build and compare machine learning models for accurate classification.

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
### 📊 **1. Data Preparation**  
- Explored the dataset to identify **26 unique classes** and their distributions.  
- Normalized images and reconstructed them for visualization.  

### 🔬 **2. Experiments & Results**  
#### ✅ **Experiment 1: SVM Models**  
- Trained **Linear SVM** and **Non-Linear SVM** using Scikit-learn.  
- Evaluated models with:  
  - **Confusion Matrices**  
  - **F1-Scores (Average)**  

#### ✅ **Experiment 3: Neural Networks (TensorFlow)**  
- Designed and trained **two neural network architectures** with varying:  
  - Hidden layers, neurons, and activation functions.  
- Saved and reloaded the **best model** for testing.  
- Plotted **accuracy and error curves** for training and validation datasets.  
- Tested with alphabet images representing team members' initials.

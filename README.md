# Handwritten Alphabets Classification

📌 **Overview**  
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten alphabets (A-Z) using a dataset of 28x28 pixel greyscale images. The project explores various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, to compare their performance on the task of image classification.

📊 **Data Sources**  
The dataset used for the project contains 28x28 pixel greyscale images of handwritten alphabets (A-Z). Each image is a 784-element vector representing one of the 26 classes (A-Z).

🔄 **Machine Learning Pipeline**

This project follows a structured approach for training and evaluating models:

### 1. **Data Exploration and Preparation**
- **Exploration**: The dataset is analyzed to check for unique classes and their distribution.
- **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized, reshaped, and flattened for model input.

### 2. **SVM Experiment**
- Trained two SVM models with linear and nonlinear kernels using **scikit-learn**.
- The models are evaluated using confusion matrices and F1 scores on the test dataset.

### 3. **Logistic Regression Experiment**
- Implemented logistic regression for one-vs-all multi-class classification.
- The model's error and accuracy curves are plotted for training and validation datasets.
- The model is evaluated with confusion matrices and F1 scores on the test dataset.

### 4. **Neural Network Experiment**
- Designed two neural networks with different configurations (hidden layers, neurons, activation functions).
- The models are trained, and error and accuracy curves are plotted for training and validation datasets.
- The best-performing model is saved, reloaded, and tested.
- The model is also tested on images representing team members' names.
